# intermediate-review

This is one of the first exercises to review our progress in Module 1 at Adalab bootcamp.
It is about the creation of a simple landing page with a minimalist style formed by a body 
occupyng the total hight of the screen and showing (in the middle) the Name and hero of a famous 
and young youtuber.
Of course, I have used his favourite coloir both for the text and the logo. The pag has also a fixed 
footer showing a copy simbol and the logo.
The design is responsive to mobile and tablet.

to develop this first prototype  i have used all the knolwdge acquired in the first 2 course weeks.
