# intermediate-review serves as Smyle VT landing page ðŸ˜Ž

This is one of the first exercises to review our progress in *Module 1 at AdalabÂ´s bootcamp*.  

It is about the creation of a **simple landing page** with a minimalist style made up of:  
1. a **body** occupyng the **total height of the screen**,
2. text **in the middle**, just the Name and Hero of the young youtuber ðŸŽ¬(of course, I have used his favourite colourâœ”),
3. a **fixed footer** showing a **copyright** and the **logo**. 


The design is **responsive** to mobile, tablet and desktop.  
In addition to that, I have implemented a **link** ðŸ”— to his **Youtube channel**, could you find it out?ðŸ‘€
