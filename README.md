# intermediate-review serves as Smyle VT ðŸ˜Ž

This is one of the first exercises to review our progress in *Module 1 at AdalabÂ´s bootcamp*.

It is about the creation of a **simple landing page** with a minimalist style made up of:
1. a **body** occupyng the **total height of the screen**,
2. text **in the middle**, just the Name and Hero of a young youtuber ðŸŽ¬(Of course, I have used his favourite colourâœ”),
3. a **fixed footer** showing a **copy simbol** and the **logo**. 


The design is **responsive** to mobile, tablet and desktop.

## The screens
mobile version ðŸ“±

tablet and desktop version ðŸ’»

To develop this first prototype I have used the **knowledge** acquired in the first 2 weeks of the course. ðŸ’ª
